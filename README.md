boomclap
========

Live audio sampler and playback beat pad.

[Live demo](http://codef.in/boomclap)

### TODO (aka good ideas that won't happen for a while)
- Disable navigation because the two-finger swipe gesture on Mac makes people navigate away
- Persistence across refresh because people want to come back to their masterpieces
- Export to MP3 or to a backend because people want to share their boomclaps
- Auto-cut clips because it's tedious
- Prepopulate sound name from english phonetic because it is difficult to remember which row is what sound
- Drag cliping handles from anywhere because people try to drag from the border
- Keyboard shortcuts for the buttons because a poweruser hates their mouse
